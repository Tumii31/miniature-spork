#Space - Mergesort takes up more room, whereas quicksort takes up less room and has strong cache locality. Quick sort is a sorting algorithm that works in real time. Sorting may be done in-place, which eliminates the need for additional storage space. Merge sort necessitates the use of a temporary array to merge the sorted arrays, which is not in-place, giving Quick sort the space benefit.
#Complex cases - By employing randomized quicksort, the worst case of quicksort can be avoided. It can be readily prevented with a high degree of certainty by selecting the appropriate pivot.
#Locality - Quicksort, in particular, has strong cache locality, which speeds up the process.
